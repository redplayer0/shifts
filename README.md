# Why
In my previous job I was responsible to assign a set of daily tasks, to a pool of people, within a specific timeframe, subject to a specific set of constraints. The  most common timeframe I worked with was a month. The specific set of constraints and factors that affect the task in general, resulted in a very time consuming task, in order to assign tasks evenly and fairly to everyone. Doing this manually, for example with pen and paper or even using spreadsheets with various functions and even macros to help me was proven to be very hard, to the point that every month I had to devoted 3-5 entire workdays to the task of assigning tasks (weird word play there). Thus I decided to develop this project to assist me in my job. The result is that by using this project, the whole process of assigning tasks takes about 2 work hours including the time it takes to type in the various constraints and factors.
